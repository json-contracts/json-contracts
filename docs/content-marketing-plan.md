description: Search-driven short-form content strategy for json-contracts and reliable LLM structured output.
---

# YouTube Content Marketing Plan

This document turns the core `json-contracts` positioning into a repeatable short-form video strategy for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, and X.

The main content thesis:

> Most developers think structured output is a prompting problem. It is actually a contract and validation problem.

Use the product as the solution, but do not position it as an LLM generator. `json-contracts` is a local MCP contract registry and validator. The model generates or repairs JSON. `json-contracts` provides schemas, rules, examples, validation, and repair guidance.

## The message to repeat

Short version:

> Prompts ask. Validators enforce.

Longer version:

> The model writes JSON. `json-contracts` gives the agent the contract, validates the result, returns repair guidance when it fails, and keeps invalid JSON away from your app.

Analogy:

```text
developer writes code -> TypeScript validates it
model writes JSON     -> json-contracts validates it
```

## Audience

Primary audience:

- Developers building AI apps
- Agent framework users
- SaaS founders adding LLM features
- Backend engineers responsible for data quality
- MCP users looking for practical MCP use cases
- Developers searching for structured output fixes

Search intent to target:

- "how to make ChatGPT return JSON"
- "how to get valid JSON from LLM"
- "why does ChatGPT add extra fields to JSON"
- "why does JSON mode still fail"
- "how to validate LLM output"
- "how to repair invalid LLM JSON"
- "MCP structured output"
- "JSON schema LLM output"
- "function calling vs structured output"
- "OpenAI structured outputs vs JSON schema"
- "Claude JSON output"
- "Ollama structured output"

## Positioning guardrails

Say this:

- `json-contracts` is a local MCP contract server.
- It provides schemas, rules, examples, validation, and repair guidance.
- It does not call LLM providers.
- It does not need API keys.
- It is model-neutral.
- Your agent/model generates the JSON.
- Validation is deterministic.
- Contracts live in Git-controlled JSON files.

Do not say this:

- "json-contracts generates JSON for you."
- "json-contracts replaces your model."
- "MCP magically fixes structured output."
- "This guarantees the model understands everything correctly."

Better phrasing:

> It does not make the model perfect. It prevents invalid JSON from silently entering your app.

## Messaging pillars

### 1. Prompts are guidance, not enforcement

A prompt can say:

```text
severity must be low, medium, high, or critical
```

But a model can still output:

```json
{
  "severity": "urgent"
}
```

A validator can reject that.

Core line:

> Your prompt cannot enforce an enum.

### 2. JSON mode is not backend validation

JSON mode may produce parseable JSON. Your app needs schema-valid JSON.

Validation answers:

- Are required fields present?
- Are enum values allowed?
- Are types correct?
- Are extra fields blocked?
- Does the output match the app contract?

Core line:

> Valid JSON and valid app data are not the same thing.

### 3. MCP makes contracts agent-usable

The MCP server exposes contract and validation tools to agents:

- `list_contracts`
- `read_contract`
- `get_json_contract`
- `get_edit_contract`
- `validate_json`
- `get_repair_contract`
- `reload_contracts`
- `status`

Core line:

> MCP turns schemas into tools your agent can use.

### 4. The repair loop is the production difference

Demo flow:

```text
prompt -> model -> JSON -> app
```

Production flow:

```text
get_json_contract
  -> model generates JSON
  -> validate_json
  -> if invalid: get_repair_contract
  -> model repairs JSON
  -> validate_json again
  -> app consumes valid JSON
```

Core line:

> Bad output should trigger repair, not a production bug.

### 5. AI behavior should be Git-controlled

Contracts are files:

```text
json-contracts/support-ticket.json
json-contracts/real-estate-lead.json
json-contracts/chart-generation.json
```

That means behavior changes can use:

- pull requests
- code review
- diffs
- rollbacks
- CI validation
- audit trails

Core line:

> AI behavior should be reviewed like code, not hidden in a prompt string.

## Advantages of pushing validation to MCP

Use these as talking points in videos, docs, launches, and comparisons.

### Less prompt clutter

Instead of injecting large schemas, rules, examples, and repair instructions manually in every app prompt, the agent asks MCP for the contract payload.

Core line:

> Stop copy-pasting schema walls into prompts.

### Deterministic validation

The model can ignore or misunderstand instructions. Validation gives a hard yes/no answer.

Core line:

> The prompt asks nicely. The validator says no.

### Model neutrality

The validation layer does not belong to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, or any framework. The same contract can be used with different models.

Core line:

> Your model can change. Your contract should not.

### Safe repair loop

The agent can validate, request repair guidance, repair with the chosen model, and validate again before the app sees the output.

Core line:

> Your AI should run its own tests before touching your app.

### Better separation of concerns

```text
LLM  = understands language and proposes JSON
MCP  = provides contracts and validates JSON
App  = consumes validated JSON
```

Core line:

> Do not make the model responsible for being your type system.

### Discoverability for agents

Because contracts are exposed as MCP tools/resources, an agent can list available behaviors and fetch the right schema when needed.

Core line:

> MCP makes structured-output behaviors discoverable.

### Git-controlled behavior

A contract file is easier to review than a hidden prompt string. Teams can track changes to schema, rules, and examples.

Core line:

> Your AI output contract deserves a pull request.

### CI validation

Contracts can be validated and linted without starting an MCP host:

```bash
json-contracts validate --contracts ./json-contracts
json-contracts lint --strict --contracts ./json-contracts
```

Core line:

> Test your AI contracts before users do.

### Explicit context

Runtime variables belong in `context`, not hidden inside user input.

```json
{
  "input": "I want to move this summer.",
  "context": {
    "current_datetime": "2026-05-03T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Core line:

> User input is input. App context is context.

### Observability and auditability

The MCP server returns deterministic `contractHash` and `schemaHash` values. Logs can capture which contract was used and why validation failed.

Core line:

> Debug AI output with hashes and validation errors, not vibes.

### Safer failure mode

Invalid output should fail closed or trigger repair instead of silently corrupting app state.

Core line:

> Invalid AI JSON should never become application state.

### No API keys in the validation layer

The MCP server does not call providers and does not need LLM API keys.

Core line:

> The thing validating your AI output should not need your AI API key.

### Dynamic behavior without MCP config churn

Adding a new contract file adds a new structured-output behavior. MCP config does not need to change.

Core line:

> Add behavior with JSON files, not framework code.

## Repeatable short-form video formula

Use this structure for most clips:

```text
0-2s: Hook the search pain or controversial belief
2-10s: Show the common broken approach
10-30s: Show the contract/validation flow
30-45s: Show the result or failure being caught
45-60s: CTA
```

Example CTA options:

- "If your AI app accepts raw model JSON, you are gambling. Use contracts."
- "Comment JSON and I will post the contract file."
- "Stop trusting model output. Validate it first."
- "Link in bio for the local MCP contract server."
- "The model writes JSON. The contract catches lies."

## Search-driven video angles

### 1. How do I make ChatGPT return valid JSON?

Title options:

- **You Cannot Prompt ChatGPT Into Valid JSON**
- **Stop Begging ChatGPT for JSON**
- **The JSON Prompt Everyone Uses Is Wrong**

Hook:

> Everyone types "return valid JSON only" and then ships broken output.

Demo:

Show a model returning:

```json
{
  "summary": "Login broken",
  "severity": "urgent"
}
```

Then show validation failing because the schema only allows:

```json
["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
```

Punchline:

> Prompts ask. Validators enforce.

### 2. Why does ChatGPT keep adding extra fields to my JSON?

Title options:

- **Why AI Keeps Inventing JSON Fields**
- **Your LLM Is Sneaking Fields Into Your Backend**
- **This One Schema Setting Blocks AI Garbage**

Hook:

> Your model is not malicious. It just does not know your backend contract matters.

Demo:

```json
{
  "summary": "Login broken",
  "severity": "high",
  "confidence": 0.94
}
```

Then show `additionalProperties: false` rejecting `confidence`.

Punchline:

> If the field is not in the contract, it does not get into your app.

### 3. Why does JSON mode still fail?

Title options:

- **JSON Mode Is Not Validation**
- **JSON Mode Can Still Break Your App**
- **Valid JSON Can Still Be Invalid Data**

Hook:

> JSON mode can give you JSON-shaped garbage.

Visual:

```text
JSON mode asks: Is it JSON?
Validation asks: Is it the JSON my app accepts?
```

Punchline:

> Valid JSON and valid app data are not the same thing.

### 4. How do I validate LLM output before using it?

Title options:

- **Never Let AI JSON Touch Your App Before This**
- **The Missing Step in Every AI App**
- **Your AI App Needs This Gatekeeper**

Hook:

> If your app consumes raw model output, you are gambling.

Demo flow:

```text
get_json_contract
-> model generates JSON
-> validate_json
-> repair if invalid
-> app consumes valid JSON
```

Punchline:

> Your backend should only see validated JSON.

### 5. Why does my AI app break when switching models?

Title options:

- **Your Structured Output Should Not Depend on One Model**
- **Why Switching From GPT to Claude Broke Your JSON**
- **Model-Specific Prompts Are a Trap**

Hook:

> You switched models and your JSON changed. Here is why.

Angle:

If the schema and rules live in a provider-specific prompt, every model switch can become a retuning project. Contracts keep the backend shape stable.

Punchline:

> Your model can change. Your contract should not.

### 6. How do I stop LLM hallucinations in JSON?

Title options:

- **The Easiest AI Hallucination to Catch Is JSON**
- **Your LLM Hallucinated a Field. Catch It.**
- **Stop AI From Inventing Backend Data**

Hook:

> In structured output, a lot of hallucinations are just validation errors.

Examples:

- hallucinated property
- invalid enum
- wrong type
- missing required field

Punchline:

> You cannot stop every hallucination, but you can stop invalid data from entering your app.

### 7. How do I use MCP for structured output?

Title options:

- **MCP Is Perfect for This Boring Problem**
- **The MCP Use Case That Actually Makes Sense**
- **MCP Turns Schemas Into Agent Tools**

Hook:

> MCP does not need to be magical. Sometimes it just gives your agent the contract it needs.

Explain:

```text
MCP does not generate the JSON.
The model generates the JSON.
MCP validates the JSON.
```

Punchline:

> MCP turns schemas into tools your agent can actually use.

### 8. How do I repair invalid LLM JSON?

Title options:

- **The AI JSON Repair Loop Most Demos Skip**
- **Bad AI JSON Should Trigger Repair, Not a Crash**
- **Do This When Your LLM Returns Broken JSON**

Hook:

> The first model output is not the final output.

Demo flow:

```text
invalid JSON
-> validate_json fails
-> get_repair_contract
-> model repairs JSON
-> validate_json passes
```

Punchline:

> Bad output should trigger repair, not a production bug.

### 9. Why do prompts fail at structured output?

Title options:

- **Your Prompt Is Pretending to Be a Type System**
- **Stop Making English Do a Compiler's Job**
- **Prompt Engineering Is Not Validation**

Hook:

> You are asking English text to do the job of a compiler.

Comparison:

```text
Bad:
Prompt says: use only these fields.

Good:
Schema says: these are the only fields.
Validator enforces it.
```

Punchline:

> Prompting is guidance. Validation is enforcement.

### 10. How do I make AI output production-ready JSON?

Title options:

- **The Difference Between Demo AI and Production AI**
- **Demo AI Prints JSON. Production AI Validates It.**
- **If There Is No Validation Step, It Is a Demo**

Hook:

> Demo AI prints JSON. Production AI validates it.

Visual:

```text
Demo:
prompt -> model -> JSON -> app

Production:
contract -> model -> validate -> repair -> validate -> app
```

Punchline:

> If there is no validation step, it is a demo.

### 11. How do I version AI prompts or AI behavior?

Title options:

- **Your AI Behavior Should Go Through Pull Requests**
- **Why Is Your AI Prompt Not in Git?**
- **Stop Hiding AI Behavior in Prompt Strings**

Hook:

> Your database schema is in Git. Why is your AI behavior hidden in a prompt string?

Demo:

Show a contract file:

```text
json-contracts/support-ticket.json
```

Then show:

```text
git diff
pull request
rollback
CI validation
```

Punchline:

> AI behavior should be reviewed like code.

### 12. How do I pass context to an LLM safely?

Title options:

- **Stop Smuggling Hidden Variables Into Prompts**
- **Your User Prompt Is Not a Junk Drawer**
- **LLM Context Should Not Be String Concatenation**

Hook:

> App variables do not belong hidden inside the user prompt.

Bad:

```text
User: I want to move this summer.
Hidden appended text: current date is 2026-05-03...
```

Better:

```json
{
  "input": "I want to move this summer.",
  "context": {
    "current_datetime": "2026-05-03T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Punchline:

> User input is input. App context is context.

## Short scripts

### Script: JSON Mode Is Not Validation

Hook:

> JSON mode is not a backend contract.

Body:

> JSON mode can make the model return JSON-shaped text. But your app needs more than that. Is `severity` actually one of your allowed enum values? Are extra fields blocked? Did the model forget a required property?

Show invalid output:

```json
{
  "summary": "Login broken",
  "severity": "urgent"
}
```

Show validation failure:

```text
/severity must be equal to one of the allowed values
```

Close:

> Use the model to write JSON. Use a contract to validate it.

### Script: This Is TypeScript for AI JSON

Hook:

> You do not trust JavaScript without TypeScript. Why trust AI JSON without a schema?

Body:

> Developers write code. TypeScript validates it. Same idea here: the model writes JSON, and `json-contracts` validates it against your contract.

Visual:

```text
developer writes code -> TypeScript validates
model writes JSON     -> json-contracts validates
```

Close:

> Structured output is not just prompting. It is contracts.

### Script: The Repair Loop Most Demos Skip

Hook:

> This is the part most AI demos skip.

Body:

> The model returns bad JSON. Most apps either crash or silently accept garbage. Instead, validate it. If it fails, ask for a repair contract, give that back to the model, and validate again.

Visual:

```text
get_json_contract
  -> model generates JSON
  -> validate_json
  -> if invalid: get_repair_contract
  -> repair and validate again
```

Close:

> Never skip validation.

### Script: Your Prompt Is Pretending to Be a Type System

Hook:

> Your prompt is pretending to be a type system.

Body:

> If your prompt says "only return these fields," the model can still add more. If your prompt says "severity must be high or low," the model can still invent `urgent`. English is guidance. Schema validation is enforcement.

Close:

> Stop making prompts do the validator's job.

## Visual patterns

Use fast repeated visuals so viewers recognize the brand.

Bad approach card:

```text
prompt -> model -> raw JSON -> app
```

Good approach card:

```text
contract -> model -> validate -> repair -> app
```

Common overlays:

- BROKEN
- INVALID ENUM
- EXTRA FIELD
- MISSING REQUIRED FIELD
- VALIDATED
- NO API KEYS
- LOCAL MCP
- GIT-CONTROLLED CONTRACTS
- FAIL CLOSED

Terminal shots:

```bash
npx -y json-contracts@latest
json-contracts validate --contracts ./json-contracts
json-contracts lint --strict --contracts ./json-contracts
```

MCP tool shots:

```text
get_json_contract
validate_json
get_repair_contract
get_edit_contract
```

## Best contracts for demos

Use the example contracts that are easiest to understand in a short clip.

1. `support-ticket`
   - Best for urgency, severity, and category.
   - Great invalid enum demo: `urgent` vs `critical`.
2. `create-filter`
   - Best for natural language to API filters.
   - Great edit demo: "last 20 closed tickets".
3. `real-estate-lead`
   - Best for real-world extraction from messy input.
   - Great context demo with `current_datetime`.
4. `ecommerce-return`
   - Relatable to non-developers.
5. `chart-generation`
   - Visually strong for dashboards and BI.

## Title formulas

Use titles that match search intent and contain a clear conflict.

```text
How do I {goal}? -> You are doing {goal} wrong
Why does {tool} {bad behavior}? -> The hidden reason {tool} fails
Stop {common workaround} -> Do {contract/validation thing} instead
{Popular feature} is not {production requirement}
The missing step in every {AI app / LLM workflow}
```

Examples:

- How do I make ChatGPT return JSON? -> Stop Begging ChatGPT for JSON
- Why does JSON mode fail? -> JSON Mode Is Not Validation
- How do I validate LLM output? -> Never Let AI JSON Touch Your App Before This
- Why does my model add fields? -> Why AI Keeps Inventing JSON Fields
- How do I use MCP? -> MCP Is Perfect for This Boring Problem

## Production checklist

Before recording:

- Pick one search-intent question.
- Pick one broken example.
- Pick one contract/demo.
- Decide the one-line punchline.
- Keep the product mention short until the payoff.

During editing:

- Show the failure in the first 5 seconds.
- Use captions for every spoken line.
- Keep code snippets large and minimal.
- Use red for invalid and green for valid.
- Repeat the contract flow visually.

Before publishing:

- Put the search phrase in the title or first sentence.
- Include `JSON`, `LLM`, `structured output`, or `MCP` in the description.
- Pin a comment with the contract flow.
- Ask a specific comment prompt such as: "Want the support-ticket contract? Comment JSON."

## Pinned comment templates

```text
The loop:
get_json_contract -> model generates JSON -> validate_json -> repair if invalid -> validate again -> app consumes valid JSON.
```

```text
Important: json-contracts does not call an LLM. Your agent/model generates the JSON. json-contracts provides the contract and validation.
```

```text
The key idea: prompts are guidance, validation is enforcement.
```

## Launch recommendation

Lead with pain, not product.

Do not start with:

> What is json-contracts?

Start with:

> JSON mode is not validation.

Then show why developers need a contract and validation loop.

The strongest repeating narrative:

```text
Bad AI apps trust model output.
Good AI apps validate it.
Great AI apps make structured output Git-controlled.
```
